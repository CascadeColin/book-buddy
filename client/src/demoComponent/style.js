"header" describes the styles for a header that is 3xl size of normal, bold font, and is centered

they are stored in a variable as a string so we can import this directly into JSX without cluttering it with inline styles

Think of this as your CSS file for Tailwind-specific styling.  For animations and custom CSS, see the "custom.css" file
